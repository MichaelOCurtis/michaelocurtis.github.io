			<h2>Solar Power</h2>
			<p>Photovoltaic solar panels convert sunlight into solar electric power. This solar electricity is used to run all electrical devices within a building.
Solar design and install photovoltaic solar power systems to be grid connected. This allows for surplus electrical solar power to be sold to any electric power provider negating the need for expensive batteries.
A range of high quality, high performance photovoltaic solar panels are available from Solar which can be fitted "on-roof" or "within-roof". As an accredited supplier and installer our installed solar power systems benefit from the maximum government solar power grant available.
Solar Power supplies and installs residential and commercial Photovoltaic solar projects.
